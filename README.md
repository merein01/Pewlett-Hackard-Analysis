# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# Overview
For this project, we were tasked to analyze Pewlett Hackard employee database using PostgreSQL to help the company anticipate many current employees that will leave for retirement. We determined the number of retiring employees per title and identified employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

# Results
Number of retiring employees per title:
Using the ERD that was created, the Retirement Titles table was created holding all the titles of employees who were born between January 1st, 1952 and December 31st, 1955.
- 90,398 employees or 37.7% of the company's total current employees will be retiring soon.
- Senior Engineer, Senior Staff and Engineer will be the most impacted positions with respectively 29,414, 28,254 and 14,222 futures retirees, which is about 12.3%, 11.8% and 5.92% of the company's workforce.
- Only 2 Managers will be retiring soon.

Employees eligible for the mentorship program:
Using the ERD created previously, the Mentorship Eligibility table was created and it holds all of the current employees who were born between January 1st, 1965 and December 31st, 1965.
- There are 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
- 294 Senior Engineers, 422 Senior Staffs and 395 Engineers are eligbible mentors.

# Summary
90,398 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
There are 1,549 eligible mentors in the company.
If we assume that they will all be willing to participate in the mentorship program, it will imply that each mentor would have an average of 58 mentees, so we can conclude that there is not enough mentors to prepare the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
The following tables give us the number of retirement-ready employees and the number of eligible mentors per department. It shows that all departments are lacking mentors.
Reviewing the criteria to qualify for the mentorship program would be needed by the company to prepare for the coming "silver tsunami".
